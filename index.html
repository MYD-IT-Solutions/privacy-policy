    <h2>iTutor Ethiopia Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Last Updated: Feb 06 2024</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome to iTutor Ethiopia! This privacy policy outlines how iTutor Ethiopia, owned by MYD IT Solutions PLC,
        collects, uses, shares, and protects your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
        the security of your personal data.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>iTutor Ethiopia collects information from users through our mobile application and web platform. We are the sole
        owners of the information collected and will not sell, share, or rent it to others. The information collected
        includes: Contact Information: When registering for our services, users are required to provide their name and
        email address. This information is used to contact users about relevant topics and to assist with password
        retrieval
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">1.1 Mobile Application Registration</h2>

    <p>In order to use some features of this application, users must first complete the registration form. During
        registration, users are required to give their contact information (name and e-mail address). This information
        is used to contact users about the topics on our mobile application for which they have expressed interest and
        to enable users to retrieve lost passwords.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">2. Web Statistics</h2>

    <p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the mobile application, and gather demographic information for
        reporting purposes. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">3. Sharing</h2>

    <p>We may share aggregated demographic information with partners, sponsors, and donors to secure funding for
        continued service provision. This information does not identify individual users.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">4. Links</h2>

    <p>This mobile application contains links to other mobile applications. Please be aware that iTutor Ethiopia does
        not claim any responsibility for the privacy practices of such other mobile applications. We encourage our users
        to be aware when they leave our mobile application and to read the privacy statements of each and every mobile
        application that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
        information collected by this mobile application.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">5. Security</h2>

    <p>This mobile application takes every precaution to protect users' information, and we have security measures in
        place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">6. Surveys</h2>

    <p>Occasionally, our mobile application requests information from users via web surveys. Participation in these
        surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
        information. Information requested may include demographic data (such as zip code and age), but nothing that can
        identify any individual person will be collected. Survey results will be used for purposes of monitoring or
        improving the use and satisfaction of this mobile application.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">7. Updates</h2>

    <p>We may also send the user mobile application and service announcement updates. Members are not able to
        unsubscribe from service announcements that contain important information about the service. We communicate with
        users to provide requested services and to discuss issues relating to their accounts via e-mail or phone.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">8. Correction/Updating Personal Information</h2>

    <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name or e-mail address), or if a user no longer
        desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that the personal data that
        was provided to us. Users can use the "My Personal Info" link from their homepage or they can e-mail our Help
        Desk to change, correct, or remove information.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">9. Choice/Opt-in</h2>

    <p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt in" to newsletters and mobile application update e-mail messages. To
        unsubscribe from mailings, please see that section above. To unsubscribe from any updates, users can use the "My
        Personal Info" link from their homepage. To avoid receiving certain topic updates, the user can simply deselect
        the topics and select the "Update" button.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">10. Notification of Changes</h2>

    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always
        aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at
        any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
        time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use
        their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
        which the information was collected.</p>
